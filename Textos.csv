39|Humanos|Machine Learning is a discipline within the field of Artificial Intelligence which, by means of algorithms, provides computers with the ability to identify patterns from mass data in order and to make predictions (predictive analytics). This learning method allows computers to perform specific tasks autonomously, that is, without the need to be programmed. The term was first used in 1959. It has, however, gained relevance in recent years due to the increase in computing capacities and the huge increase in data. Automatic learning techniques are, in fact, a fundamental part of Big Data. 
40|Humanos|Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. 
41|Humanos|Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data. UC Berkeleybreaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts. A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data. An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model. A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met. 
42|Humanos|The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work.

52|Humanos|The deadliest virus in modern history, perhaps of all time, was the 1918 Spanish Flu. It killed about 20 to 50 million people worldwide, perhaps more. The total death toll is unknown because medical records were not kept in many areas. The pandemic hit during World War I and devastated military troops. In the United States, for instance, more servicemen were killed from the flu than from the war itself. The Spanish flu was fatal to a higher proportion of young adults than most flu viruses.
53|Humanos|A third wave occurred in the winter and spring of 1919, and a fourth, smaller wave occurred in a few areas in spring 1920. Initial symptoms of the flu were typical: sore throat, headache, and fever. The flu often progressed rapidly to cause severe pneumonia and sometimes hemorrhage in the lungs and mucus membranes. A characteristic feature of severe cases of the Spanish Flu was heliotrope cyanosis, where the patient’s face turned blue from lack of oxygen in the cells. Death usually followed within hours or days.
54|Humanos|In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth in danger.
55|Humanos|Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.
56|Humanos|The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body, has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
57|Humanos|The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
58|Humanos|Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.
59|Humanos|Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife. In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
60|Humanos|Two football fans were arrested last night near the stadium. The suspects were taken to the police station for further investigation. They allegedly stole a brand new Ferrari. The owner of the car told the police that the thieves were wearing a football team jersey. After the suspects were caught, the owner of the car was called to identify the thieves. However, the owner of the car said that he had made a huge mistake because the car hadn’t been stolen. The car had been taken by his wife to go to a concert because her car was broken.
61|Humanos|Her husband, Yothin, was working as the chief electrician on the 24th floor of the unfinished tower when it collapsed. She and Yothin - who are both in their mid-30s - are from a village in northern Thailand. Yothin came to Bangkok to work on the construction site and send the money back to his family. Kannika has travelled more than 300km in the aftermath of the earthquake to wait for news about her missing husband. He's one of thousands of workers in Thailand who migrate to the capital to try to build a better future for their family.
62|Humanos|Donald Trump has said he "couldn't care less" if carmakers raise prices after his 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles comes into effect. Some analysts have warned that Trump's charges on businesses importing vehicles could lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. But speaking to NBC News on Saturday, the US president said he hoped foreign carmakers raise prices as it means "people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty".
63|ChatGpt|TikTok is a short-form video platform that has transformed how people create and consume content online. Launched in 2016, the app quickly gained global popularity, especially among younger audiences. Users can record and share videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, often accompanied by music, filters, and effects. What makes TikTok unique is its algorithm, which learns user preferences and recommends a continuous stream of personalized content. This has helped new creators go viral without needing a large following. Although it’s known for dance trends and lip-syncing, TikTok also hosts educational content, political commentary, and niche communities. However, the platform has faced criticism over privacy concerns and its impact on mental health. Still, it remains one of the most downloaded apps worldwide.
64|ChatGpt|TikTok has redefined the meaning of internet trends. Challenges, sounds, and memes originating on the app often spread rapidly across other platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Its “For You” page delivers a never-ending feed of personalized videos, making it easy for users to spend hours scrolling. Content creators can gain thousands of followers overnight, and the platform has even launched music careers and viral products. Despite being a source of entertainment, some experts warn about TikTok’s addictive nature. The app encourages fast consumption and quick gratification, which may affect attention spans. Still, for many users, TikTok is a space for creativity and self-expression.
65|ChatGpt|Unlike traditional social media, TikTok focuses less on who you follow and more on what you engage with. The app collects interaction data—likes, shares, watch time—to build a highly tailored experience. This system helps surface fresh content that’s likely to interest each individual. Many brands now use TikTok to reach younger audiences through influencers or viral marketing. While its popularity is undeniable, it has also raised geopolitical concerns, especially in the U.S., where lawmakers have questioned its ownership and data practices. Nevertheless, TikTok remains a dominant force in digital culture, shaping the way millions interact online.

69|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|The Lord of the Rings: The Rise of Skywalker is a big movie with big ideas and big action, but it’s missing something. It’s missing the spark of Star Wars that made the franchise great. The Rise of Skywalker tries to tie up loose ends from the previous two trilogies, but it does so in a way that feels forced and unsatisfying. The plot is convoluted and the pacing is awkward. Characters make strange decisions, and fan service moments often interrupt the narrative flow. Despite impressive visuals and fast-paced sequences, the emotional stakes fall flat. The film rushes through major revelations without giving them the weight they deserve.

71|Modelo Red Green - Boost 2.0|The deadliest virus in modern history, the Spanish Flu, killed at least 50 million people worldwide in 1918-19, according to the World Health Organization. The virus was particularly deadly in healthy adults in their 30s, a demographic that was typically at the peak of its physical and productive powers. This year marks the 100th anniversary of that pandemic. The Spanish Flu was a catalyst for the development of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as well as for many of today's public health practices. The Spanish Flu was a harbinger of the dangers that pandemics pose, and the need for the world's nations to collaborate on public health crises, as we see happening now in the battle against the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. The Spanish Flu was a global catastrophe that occurred in three waves.
72|Modelo Red Green - Boost 2.0|The deadliest virus in modern history, the Spanish Flu, was not caused by a mutated strain of avian flu but rather a H1N1 virus, a strain of the flu that circulates every year. In fact, it is estimated that at least 50% of human seasonal H1N1 infections are caused by swine-origin H1N1 viruses, according to a study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues. This means that there are still many things we don’t know about the H1N1 virus, which is why the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public health organizations are working hard to monitor and respond to outbreaks of the flu in the United States. One way they are doing this is by using a process called genomic surveillance.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in 2016 found that 1,700 people die in Delhi and its neighbouring regions due to air pollution every single day. The pollution in Delhi-NCR is so severe that it often ranks among the top three most polluted cities in the world. Yet, the pollution crisis in Delhi-NCR remains a neglected issue. There are no political will to address it and there’s no real action. The pollution crisis in Delhi is so severe that every single day, about 1,700 people die in Delhi.
81|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|Air pollution is a pressing issue in Delhi. The capital city recorded its highest level of pollution in 17 years on Friday, with the pollution control board’s index for the national capital crossing 999. The pollution control board has advised residents to avoid any physical work or exercise outdoors. The pollution in Delhi is mostly due to a dense smog caused by emissions from vehicles, stubble burning in neighbouring states and the low wind speed. There are various solutions to combat air pollution in Delhi. Here are five ways to do so: 1. Increase public transport: Delhi’s public transport needs a massive overhaul.
82|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|Air pollution is not just outside our homes. There are hidden dangers lurking inside them, too. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified indoor air pollution as one of the top environmental health risks to public health. The pollutants are invisible, but can cause significant health problems, such as respiratory ailments, asthma, and even cancer. Here are some common indoor air pollutants and how to manage them. Carbon Monoxide: This is colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas that is highly toxic to humans. Carbon monoxide is produced from incomplete burning of fuels, such as oil, gas, kerosene, and wood. Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of tobacco smoke. 
83|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|The head, or the spherical body part, is the most vulnerable when playing airsoft. There are many different options for head protection, but one of the most popular choices is the airsoft helmet. These helmets not only protect the head, but can also provide additional benefits such as increased ballistic protection, better vision, and increased tactical functionality. Here we will explore the top airsoft helmets on the market today. Airsoft Helmet Benefits. Helmets in the airsoft community serve both functional and aesthetic purposes. Here are some of the top reasons players choose to wear helmets: - Head Protection: The most obvious benefit is to protect the player’s head from incoming projectiles. A well-designed helmet can help absorb the impact of BBs, thus minimizing the potential for injury. - Ballistic Protection: In addition to standard BB protection, some airsoft helmets offer ballistic protection against higher-velocity rounds.
84|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|The head of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is urging Congress to pass a bill that would require all U.S. airlines to adopt the flight data and voice recorders used in most airplanes today, but not yet in use by some smaller operators. The bill, the Flight Data Recorder Modernization Act of 2018, was introduced in July by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. The bill would require that by Jan. 1, 2022, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must require that every U.S. aircraft weighing more than 12,500 pounds be equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder that record and store data for 25 hours. 
85|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|TikTok is full of fun dance trends, but one recent viral challenge has an important message. The #WearARedDress challenge encourages women to wear red to show their support for the millions of survivors of domestic violence. Here's everything you need to know about this important trend. What is the #WearARedDress challenge? The #WearARedDress challenge was started by women's empowerment and lifestyle magazine, Bustle, to support National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which runs throughout October. The goal of the challenge is for women to wear red clothing to show their support for the millions of survivors of domestic violence and to raise awareness about the prevalence of this issue. The challenge has gained popularity on social media, with many women posting photos and videos of themselves wearing red on social media sites like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.
86|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|TikTok is rolling out a new feature that will allow users to add a caption to a specific part of their video, just like on Instagram and other platforms. The new feature, aptly called “Caption on Clips,” will allow users to add a caption to a specific part of their video, making it easier to add context or humor to a specific moment. According to a screenshot of the new feature shared by app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, users can select the part of the video they want to add a caption to by drawing a rectangle around it. They can then add a caption, just like they would on a still image. The text added to the clip will appear as a speech bubble, with a play button that users can tap to watch the clip. The new feature is likely to be popular with TikTok users, as it will allow them to add more context and humor to their videos.
87|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|TikTok is rolling out a new feature that is going to put more videos on your screen. The app is now testing a full-screen browsing mode that is going to make it easier to watch videos. TikTok has been around for a couple of years now, but it only recently became popular. The app currently has hundreds of millions of users, but in some regions, it’s even more successful. TikTok is now becoming so successful that it even managed to surpass Instagram in some regions. The app was developed and released by Beijing-based Bytedance. The app was developed as a successor of Musical.ly, but it quickly became more successful. Earlier this year, TikTok introduced a new video format that is called “Sounds.” With this feature, users can use popular sounds and music in their videos. The app currently has a huge catalog of sounds and music that users can use.
90|Modelo Red Green - Boost 2.0|Donald Trump has reportedly called for a complete shut-down on Muslim immigration to the US in order to prevent terrorism. The presumptive Republican nominee called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on” in an official statement today (7 December). According to Trump's campaign, the statement was issued after a series of attacks in California and a call to action to attack American Christians by a radical Muslim cleric. The Republican presidential candidate added: "Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life."
91|Modelo LLAW - Boost 2|A third wave occurred in the winter of 2014–2015, but since then, the prevalence of MERS-CoV has declined significantly, with small numbers of sporadic cases reported per year. The WHO reported a decline in MERS-CoV activity in 2016, but in 2017, the total number of cases and deaths reported was the highest since the initial outbreak in 2012. The total number of reported cases as of November 2019 was 2,494, with a case fatality rate of 34.4%. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
92|Humanos|In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it’s happening again to Big Mike’s successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.
93|Humanos|Unfortunately, these conditions are also perfect for the spread of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, which attacks the plant’s roots and prevents it from transporting water to the stem and leaves. The TR-1 strain of the fungus was resistant to crop sprays and travelled around on boots or the tyres of trucks, slowly infecting plantations across the region. In an attempt to escape the fungus, farmers abandoned infected fields, flooded them and then replanted crops somewhere else, often cutting down rainforest to do so.
94|Humanos|Racing against the inevitable, scientists are working on solving the problem by genetically modifying the Cavendish with genes from TR-4-resistant banana species. Researchers at the Queensland University of Technology have successfully grown two kinds of modified plant which have remained resistant for three years so far. But some experts think this is just a sophisticated version of the same temporary solution the original Cavendish provided. If the new bananas are planted in the same monocultures as the Cavendish and the Gros Michel before it, the risk is that another strain of the disease may rise up to threaten the modified plants too.
95|Humanos|When I first heard that Shonda Rhimes would make her Netflix debut with Bridgerton, a sweeping period drama about scandal and class taking place during Regency-era London’s debutante season, I was sold. My hopes were high for what sounded like some sort of 19th century Gossip Girl, until I watched it. After a few episodes, I found some elements of the series to be irksome. But there was one prevailing problem with which I took issue. The rules that the world of Bridgerton asks its viewers to accept—namely, it being a historically accurate reflection of high society from that era—are flimsy, and transferring contemporary American politics to characters from 19th century London has implications in the current moment that cannot be taken lightly.
96|Humanos|The cartoonish fantasy and romance in Bridgerton aren’t the problem—people, living isolated in their homes while a virus ravages the planet, need both of those things acutely right now. Why else do you think Emily in Paris was such a success, despite being ridiculed by critics at every turn? Escapism is a necessity at the moment, and while we’re choosing our own adventures at home, there are legions of viewers who would prefer to go full Shondaland fantasy (Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal fans know what this means) than dive into something like The Mandalorian.
97|Humanos|Again, Scandal fans may have already clocked this—but this moment calls to mind the scene in which Olivia Pope’s father reminds her why Black people have to be “twice as good” at everything to get half the respect that white folks receive. For Scandal, a contemporary show made during the Obama era about a political fixer, that sort of speech worked. Trying to retrofit those same contemporary racial politics onto Bridgerton does not.
98|Humanos|Bridgerton's latest serving of high society seduction and scandal is as beguiling as ever, some critics have declared - although others think the Netflix series' charms are wearing off. The show's third season has been described as "its best yet" and "still unbearably sexy". But other reviewers cautioned that it's "losing its bite", and that its period drama formula "is wearing decidedly thin". Four episodes were released on Thursday, with the second half of the third season due to arrive in June.
99|Humanos|Bridgerton, the first TV series made by Shondaland for Netflix, hit both Britain and the USA on December 25, 2020. A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy. The show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic “Bridgerton“ offers. 
101|ChatGpt|TikTok has transformed the way people consume and create content. What began as a platform for short dance videos has evolved into a space for education, activism, humor, and marketing. With its algorithm-driven feed, TikTok ensures that creators can go viral regardless of their follower count, democratizing digital fame. This has made it especially popular among Gen Z, who use the app not only for entertainment but also for self-expression and community-building. Brands, too, have recognized its power, launching campaigns that target trends and memes to boost visibility. However, concerns about data privacy and the platform’s influence on mental health continue to raise questions.
102|ChatGpt|Donald Trump continues to be one of the most polarizing figures in modern American politics. His presidency marked a shift in tone, strategy, and communication, particularly through his use of social media. Supporters praise him for challenging political norms, promoting economic growth, and focusing on American interests. Critics, however, highlight his divisive rhetoric, policy decisions, and handling of major crises. Even after leaving office, Trump’s influence remains strong within the Republican Party, and he continues to shape political discourse through rallies, endorsements, and public statements. His potential return to the political stage in future elections is a subject of intense speculation. 
103|ChatGpt|Bridgerton offers more than just romance and drama; it provides a lens into a reimagined past. Through its lavish sets and character-driven storytelling, the show creates an alternate history where race, gender, and class are explored with nuance and fantasy. What sets Bridgerton apart is its willingness to challenge genre conventions while remaining entertaining. The show’s narrator, Lady Whistledown, adds a layer of intrigue and commentary, reminiscent of modern gossip culture. Viewers are drawn not just to the relationships but also to the power struggles and emotional complexity. 
105|ChatGpt|TikTok is increasingly being used as a tool for learning and skill development. Beyond dance challenges and lip-syncing, users now share tutorials on cooking, coding, language learning, and financial literacy. Short videos, often under one minute, make complex topics more digestible. This shift has transformed TikTok into a micro-learning hub. Experts and educators are leveraging the platform to reach younger audiences in creative ways. However, the informal nature of content raises concerns about accuracy and misinformation.
106|ChatGpt|TikTok trends now influence not only pop culture but also consumer behavior. Viral product reviews, “TikTok made me buy it” hauls, and user-generated ads have turned the app into a powerful marketing engine. Small businesses in particular benefit from organic exposure. A single viral video can drive massive traffic and sales, often without paid promotion. As a result, brands closely monitor the platform, trying to stay ahead of trends and connect with audiences authentically.
107|ChatGpt|Donald Trump has reshaped the role of the modern political figure. Unlike traditional politicians, he leveraged his celebrity status to bypass conventional media, using direct communication to energize his base. His speeches, often controversial, were designed to provoke and dominate news cycles. This strategy changed how political campaigns are run, placing greater emphasis on media visibility and emotional resonance. While many disagree with his methods, his approach undeniably transformed the landscape of political messaging.
110|Humanos|Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast are the broad valley of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the hilly coastal plain of Valencia.
111|Humanos|Spain’s countryside is quaint, speckled with castles, aqueducts, and ancient ruins, but its cities are resoundingly modern. The Andalusian capital of Sevilla (Seville) is famed for its musical culture and traditional folkways; the Catalonian capital of Barcelona for its secular architecture and maritime industry; and the national capital of Madrid for its winding streets, its museums and bookstores, and its around-the-clock lifestyle. Madrid is Spain’s largest city and is also its financial and cultural centre, as it has been for hundreds of years.
112|Humanos|Spain was arguably the richest country in the world, and certainly the most far-flung. With the steady erosion of its continental and overseas empire throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, however, Spain was all but forgotten in world affairs, save for the three years that the ideologically charged Spanish Civil War (1936–39) put the country at the centre of the world’s stage, only to become ever more insular and withdrawn during the four decades of rule by dictator Francisco Franco. Following Franco’s death in 1975, a Bourbon king, Juan Carlos, returned to the throne and established a constitutional monarchy. The country has been ruled since then by a succession of elected governments, some socialist, some conservative, but all devoted to democracy.
113|Humanos|Spain is bordered to the west by Portugal; to the northeast it borders France, from which it is separated by the tiny principality of Andorra and by the great wall of the Pyrenees Mountains. Spain’s only other land border is in the far south with Gibraltar, an enclave that belonged to Spain until 1713, when it was ceded to Great Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Elsewhere the country is bounded by water: by the Mediterranean Sea to the east and southeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the northwest and southwest, and by the Bay of Biscay (an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean) to the north. 
114|Humanos|Spain accounts for five-sixths of the Iberian Peninsula, the roughly quadrilateral southwestern tip of Europe that separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. Most of Spain comprises a large plateau (the Meseta Central) divided by a mountain range, the Central Sierra (Sistema Central), which trends west-southwest to east-northeast. Several mountains border the plateau: the Cantabrian Mountains (Cordillera Cantábrica) to the north, the Iberian Cordillera (Sistema Ibérico) to the northeast and east, the Sierra Morena to the south, and the lower mountains of the Portuguese frontier and Spanish Galicia to the northwest. 
115|Humanos|Spaniards frequently drink wine and beer with their meals. They also commonly drink bottled mineral water, even though in most parts of the country the tap water is perfectly safe. At breakfast and after meals, strong coffee is the almost universal drink. Few people drink tea, but herbal infusions such as chamomile are popular. Soft drinks, both domestic and imported, are widely available.
116|Humanos|Trump’s conviction took place on May 30, 2024, when a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment in 2016 to the adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006. He had also been indicted on dozens of other federal and state charges in cases relating to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the presidential election of 2020 and his removal of numerous classified documents from the White House upon leaving office. 
117|Humanos|Trump is the third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection” in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Both of Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S. Senate.
118|Humanos|Trump issued a third version of the ban, which continued to apply to immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries but now included immigrants from North Korea and certain government officials of Venezuela. The Supreme Court then vacated as moot the cases it had been scheduled to hear regarding the second travel ban. The third ban, like the previous two, was immediately challenged and enjoined, but the Supreme Court stayed the injunctions in December pending review by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits (which upheld them).
119|Humanos|Trump’s personal style is unusual, if not unique, among national political figures in modern U.S. history. In part reflecting his experiences as a prominent figure in the New York real estate industry, Trump is fiercely competitive as well as intensely concerned with demonstrating his success and accomplishments to others. Indeed, from the very beginning of his career, he has cultivated and cherished his reputation as a shrewd businessman, an image that often aided him in his real estate dealings and which he eventually exploited as a brand beginning in the 1990s. 
120|Humanos|Trump in his business career characteristically used blunt language as a weapon against his rivals and adversaries, pointedly insulting or belittling them in the press in retaliation for their real or perceived slights. Perhaps surprisingly, Trump did not significantly alter his style or temper his rhetoric upon his entry into politics, notwithstanding the conventional view that success in politics is necessarily a matter of persuasion and compromise rather than “hitting back harder.” The advent of Twitter in 2006 eventually gave Trump (who joined the service in 2009) a larger platform for his unfiltered political comments, once he began regularly tweeting about politics in about 2011. 
121|Humanos|TikTok, social media platform designed for creating, editing, and sharing short videos between 15 seconds and three minutes in length. TikTok provides songs and sounds as well as filters and special effects that users can add to their videos. Users also have the option to upload videos from their own devices to TikTok. TikTok is available to people in most countries around the world. China has a separate version called Douyin that has the same basic functionality but includes content of interest to the Chinese public.
122|Humanos|TikTok users can make and share videos on any topic. Comedic and educational videos are common, and others challenge users to dance, to lip-synch, or to complete a nonsensical act, such as rolling on the ground like a tumbleweed. TikTok provides guidelines for submissions, but sometimes users post dangerous or illegal content, such as dares that involve safety risks. One challenge sparked a wave of car thefts across North America after TikTok users demonstrated a security flaw in certain models of Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Critics, as well as the owners of the app, advise users to remain cautious about the type of stunts they choose to perform and share. Likewise, they suggest that parents regulate their children’s activity on TikTok. To that end, TikTok has added a feature that monitors screen time and allows users to set reminders to take breaks.
123|Humanos|Trump, who was elected president in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, has expressed that he would keep TikTok available to Americans, and asked the Supreme Court to delay their decision. The Supreme Court, however, upheld Biden’s ruling in January 2025, and the app was scheduled to be banned starting the day before Trump was inaugurated into office. The app would remain on users’ phones, but it would no longer be available for download on app stores, and there would be no new updates, leading it to eventually become slower and less reliable. Trump stated that he would pass an executive order (coinciding closely with his inauguration date) to prevent the ban from taking effect. It is uncertain whether such an order would have staying power—it may merely delay the inevitable.
124|Humanos|Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final.
125|Humanos|Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team.
126|Humanos|Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain.
127|Humanos|Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 along with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the "Hala Madrid y nada más", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois. The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2024.
128|Humanos|Real Madrid are one of the most successful football clubs in the world and most successful in Europe. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga. In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships. Madrid was ranked joint first a record number of times in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for the years 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2024. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.
129|Humanos|Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS, while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55), a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored. Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013–14).
130|Humanos|Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them. The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million. Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari. 
131|Humanos|Bridgerton, blockbuster Netflix romance drama series (2020– ) created by Chris Van Dusen and produced by Shonda Rhimes’s production company, Shondaland. The show, inspired by the eight-book historical fiction series written by author Julia Quinn, follows each of the eight close-knit Bridgerton siblings in their respective journeys to find a match in high-society London during the Regency era (between 1811 and 1820).
132|Humanos|Bridgerton has hooked many devoted fans with its diverse casting. Notably Rhimes’s “color-conscious” casting led to a great deal of media attention, both negative and positive, especially as the original novels’ characters are written to be white. The prequel spin-off, Queen Charlotte (2023), spotlights the oppression faced by Black members of the Ton, especially as Queen Charlotte herself (India Amarteifio; her older counterpart is played by Golda Rosheuvel) is Black and marries King George III (Corey Mylchreest; older counterpart is James Fleet), who is white. Their marriage is scrutinized, especially by George’s mother. In the main Netflix series, however, racial issues are rarely, if ever, mentioned. Some critics have spoken negatively about Rhimes’s race-blind approach, calling Bridgerton’s handling of race “clumsy.” Many have also criticized colorism in the show, observing that lighter-skinned Black actors usually play nobility, while darker-skinned actors occupy minor roles.
133|Humanos|Bridgerton became a global phenomenon after its release and was well received by audiences around the world. Within the first month of its premiere on December 25, 2020, the show hit a streaming record of 82 million households worldwide. Its second season premiere became Netflix’s third most popular English-language TV series in just 17 days. 
134|Humanos|Bridgerton is a period drama set in the sexy, lavish and competitive world of Regency London high society. From the glittering ballrooms of Mayfair to the aristocratic palaces of Park Lane and beyond, the series unveils a seductive, sumptuous world replete with intricate rules and dramatic power struggles, where no one is truly ever on steady ground. At the heart of the show is the powerful Bridgerton family. Comprised of eight close-knit siblings, this funny, witty, daring, and clever group must navigate the upper ten thousand's marriage mart in search of romance, adventure and love.
135|Humanos|The gaseous air pollutants of primary concern in urban settings include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. These gases are released directly into the air from fossil fuels such as fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas that are burned in power plants, automobiles, and other sources. Ozone (a key component of smog) is also a gaseous pollutant that forms in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides react with hydrocarbons such as gasoline vapors.
136|Humanos|The release of gases or particles into the atmosphere faster than the environment can naturally dissipate and dilute or absorb them is called air pollution. Such substances may cause undesirable health, economic, or aesthetic effects. Air pollution that remains outside in wide-open spaces can be just as dangerous as air pollution that gets trapped inside buildings, cars, or other enclosed spaces.
137|Humanos|Air toxics may be released in sudden and catastrophic accidents rather than steadily and gradually from many sources. For example, in the Bhopal, India, disaster of 1984, an accidental release of methyl isocyanate at a pesticide factory immediately killed at least 3,000 people. In addition, this disaster eventually caused the deaths of an estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people over the following quarter-century and injured hundreds of thousands more.
138|ChatGpt|Bridgerton has become a global phenomenon that transcends the typical boundaries of a period drama. Produced by Shondaland, the series incorporates themes such as female empowerment, social mobility, and romantic agency. Each season introduces a new primary couple while preserving the interconnected dynamics of the Bridgerton family. This structure allows the show to explore diverse emotional arcs and cultural topics within a consistent narrative framework. Internationally, it has increased interest in Regency-era England and sparked fashion trends inspired by its lavish costumes and set design. The series demonstrates how historical fiction can be reinvented to reflect contemporary values while still captivating mainstream audiences.
139|ChatGpt|Bridgerton also plays a key role in discussions about representation in historical narratives. By casting actors of color in high-society roles traditionally portrayed as white, the show challenges assumptions about historical accuracy and opens space for alternative storytelling. This creative choice invites viewers to reconsider how history is depicted in media, and whether artistic interpretation can — or should — reshape the public’s understanding of the past. The result is both thought-provoking and visually striking, making Bridgerton a landmark in inclusive storytelling.
140|ChatGpt|TikTok has disrupted traditional media hierarchies by giving ordinary users the chance to shape global conversations. Unlike platforms that prioritize celebrities and influencers, TikTok’s algorithm favors engagement and creativity, allowing unknown creators to gain recognition overnight. This has democratized content creation, giving rise to new forms of humor, storytelling, and activism. The platform has also changed how trends emerge and evolve, often spreading from niche communities to mainstream culture in a matter of days. Its impact on the music industry, fashion, and even language demonstrates the cultural power of short-form video.
141|ChatGpt|TikTok’s rise has also sparked regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Governments and institutions are raising concerns about data privacy, national security, and content moderation. Some countries have imposed restrictions or outright bans, citing the platform’s Chinese ownership as a potential risk. These debates highlight the tension between innovation and regulation in the digital age. As TikTok continues to grow, it must navigate complex legal and ethical challenges while maintaining user trust and creative freedom.
143|ChatGpt|Donald Trump's communication strategy redefined how leaders engage with the public. His frequent and often provocative use of Twitter broke with presidential norms, creating a direct, unfiltered line to millions of followers. This approach allowed him to dominate media coverage and shape narratives instantly, often bypassing traditional journalistic gatekeepers. While this method energized his base, it also led to widespread criticism and platform suspensions. Nonetheless, Trump’s media tactics remain a case study in modern political branding and digital influence.
144|ChatGpt|Bridgerton challenges traditional gender roles within its period setting by presenting strong female characters who actively shape their own destinies. The women in the series are not mere subjects of marriage negotiations, but individuals with desires, ambitions, and agency. Characters like Daphne and Eloise navigate societal expectations in distinct ways — one embracing romance, the other resisting conformity. This duality enriches the narrative, offering multiple perspectives on womanhood in a historical context. Through dialogue and plot, the show raises questions about autonomy, power, and the constraints placed on women in both past and present societies.
145|ChatGpt|TikTok has introduced a new era of digital communities based on shared interests rather than existing social networks. Users often find themselves in “sides” of TikTok — such as BookTok, FinanceTok, or CleanTok — where algorithmic curation fosters highly niche content ecosystems. These micro-communities allow for deeper engagement and more meaningful exchanges among users who may never have met otherwise. As a result, TikTok functions not only as an entertainment platform but also as a space for belonging and identity exploration. The phenomenon highlights the shift from broadcast-based media to participatory, interest-driven interaction.
146|ChatGpt|Donald Trump has influenced political discourse far beyond the borders of the United States. His populist messaging, emphasis on nationalism, and confrontational rhetoric have inspired similar movements around the world. Political leaders in various countries have adopted comparable strategies, appealing to disenfranchised voters through anti-establishment narratives. Trump’s global impact illustrates how political styles and ideologies can spread rapidly in the digital age. Scholars continue to study how his leadership has altered not only American politics, but also the tone and structure of democratic systems internationally.
147|ChatGpt|Donald Trump’s presidency brought new attention to the relationship between politics and media. His frequent confrontations with journalists, coupled with the phrase “fake news,” intensified public skepticism toward traditional news outlets. Meanwhile, his administration prioritized alternative media channels and direct communication to shape public opinion. This shift raised fundamental questions about media trust, journalistic responsibility, and the balance between free speech and misinformation. As a result, the Trump era marked a turning point in how the press and political power interact in the 21st century.
148|Humanos|Spain is in southwestern Europe and has borders with France (in the north) and Portugal (in the west). Most of its territory is a peninsula, but it also has two large archipelagos. The Balearic Islands are off the coast of Catalonia and the region of Valencia. The Canary Islands are in the Atlantic ocean, about 1,500 kilometres from the Andalusian coast, the southernmost end of the peninsula. Spain also has to Autonomous Cities: Ceuta and Melilla. They are in northern Africa and connected by frequent ferry services to the coast of Andalusia. 
149|Humanos|Spain is enduring its worst flooding disaster in decades with at least 95 people dead and dozens more missing after huge rains swept the eastern province of Valenica and beyond. Torrential rain on Tuesday triggered flash floods which swept away bridges and buildings and forced people to climb onto roofs or cling to trees to survive. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has declared three days of national mourning as the wild conditions continue, restricting some rescue efforts. The death toll is feared to climb as "many people are still missing," the government says.
150|Humanos|Spain is bordered to the west by Portugal; to the northeast it borders France, from which it is separated by the tiny principality of Andorra and by the great wall of the Pyrenees Mountains. Spain’s only other land border is in the far south with Gibraltar, an enclave that belonged to Spain until 1713, when it was ceded to Great Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Elsewhere the country is bounded by water: by the Mediterranean Sea to the east and southeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the northwest and southwest, and by the Bay of Biscay (an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean) to the north. 
151|Humanos|Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast are the broad valley of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the hilly coastal plain of Valencia.
153|Humanos|Bridgerton is the tale, set in 1813 London, of the Regency rivalry between the lordly Bridgerton family and the lordly Featherington family who are each keen to be seen as the most lordly of lordly families and lord it mostly lordily over the rest of Regency London’s high society. We are in the Regency period, btw, and London. I, like the writers of the show, wish to make this very clear (the extensive filming in Bath notwithstanding).
154|Humanos|If this review is a mess, I blame “Bridgerton,” the raunchy, Regency(ish)-era soap opera produced by Shonda Rhimes for Netflix. I believe I have sustained a “Bridgerton”-related brain injury while trying to mentally accommodate a world where soft porn meets Lisa Frank meets... not Jane Austen, but someone who has definitely heard of Jane Austen. Someone who doesn’t realize that Austen was already skewering the shallowness of society and has decided to skewer Austen by pointing out that society is mean to women. But with very wacky hair and clothes!
155|Humanos|This is the beginning of a nearly nonstop jeremiad on the callous mistreatment of women during this era. Every episode has at least one woman delivering lamentations on the subject of How Society Is Unfair To Women. I thought often of the scene in “Blazing Saddles” where several vicious cowboys beat up an old woman. In between punches to the gut, she looks straight into the camera and cries, “Have you ever seen such cruelty?” The feminism of “Bridgerton” is that subtle. 
156|Humanos|Donald Trump stunned the political world in 2016 when he became the first person without government or military experience ever to be elected president of the United States. His four-year tenure in the White House revealed extraordinary fissures in American society but left little doubt that he is a figure unlike any other in the nation’s history. Trump, the New York businessman and former reality TV show star, won the 2016 election after a campaign that defied norms and commanded public attention from the moment it began. His approach to governing was equally unconventional.
157|Humanos|Trump’s policy record included major changes at home and abroad. He achieved a string of long-sought conservative victories domestically, including the biggest corporate tax cuts on record, the elimination of scores of environmental regulations and a reshaping of the federal judiciary. In the international arena, he imposed tough new immigration restrictions, withdrew from several multilateral agreements, forged closer ties with Israel and launched a tit-for-tat trade dispute with China as part of a wider effort to address what he saw as glaring imbalances in America’s economic relationship with other countries. 
158|Humanos|Trump’s aggressive and racist approach to immigration, his disengagement from foreign alliances, his tendency to praise autocrats and dismiss liberal democratic foreign leaders, and his refusal to disavow white supremacist groups marked a profound break from the past. Although he favored certain “traditional” Republican Party positions—including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017—and appointed socially conservative justices from the same list that any Republican president would have used, his rhetoric and priorities shifted the Republican Party decidedly.
159|Humanos|Trump’s presidency also shined a light on an aspect of the American presidency and the operations of democratic governance that had frequently been overlooked in public life: the importance of political and social norms and the degree to which the system depended on a mutual respect for them. Although many laws govern the behavior of elected officials, many of the practices Americans had come to expect from their leaders were not codified in law but rather in tradition—what social scientists call norms. Trump, who prided himself on his independence and unique approach to politics, routinely violated political norms.

161|Humanos|In fact, 8 in 10 global Gen Zs reported that they go to TikTok for entertainment, a true testament to how the app is shaping their relationship with global pop culture. However, there is a variety of content posted on the app from topics ranging from entertainment to current events. 78% of global Gen Z respondents reported that they keep up with the news and current events through social media such as TikTok. Social media has always influenced how information is created and shared, but TikTok is elevating expectations to new levels.
