39|Humanos|Machine Learning is a discipline within the field of Artificial Intelligence which, by means of algorithms, provides computers with the ability to identify patterns from mass data in order and to make predictions (predictive analytics). This learning method allows computers to perform specific tasks autonomously, that is, without the need to be programmed. The term was first used in 1959. It has, however, gained relevance in recent years due to the increase in computing capacities and the huge increase in data. Automatic learning techniques are, in fact, a fundamental part of Big Data. 
40|Humanos|Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. 
41|Humanos|Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data. UC Berkeleybreaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts. A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data. An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model. A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met. 
42|Humanos|The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien.

52|Humanos|The deadliest virus in modern history, perhaps of all time, was the 1918 Spanish Flu. It killed about 20 to 50 million people worldwide, perhaps more. The total death toll is unknown because medical records were not kept in many areas. The pandemic hit during World War I and devastated military troops. In the United States, for instance, more servicemen were killed from the flu than from the war itself. The Spanish flu was fatal to a higher proportion of young adults than most flu viruses.
53|Humanos|A third wave occurred in the winter and spring of 1919, and a fourth, smaller wave occurred in a few areas in spring 1920. Initial symptoms of the flu were typical: sore throat, headache, and fever. The flu often progressed rapidly to cause severe pneumonia and sometimes hemorrhage in the lungs and mucus membranes. A characteristic feature of severe cases of the Spanish Flu was heliotrope cyanosis, where the patient’s face turned blue from lack of oxygen in the cells. Death usually followed within hours or days.
54|Humanos|In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth in danger.
55|Humanos|Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.
56|Humanos|The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body, has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
57|Humanos|The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
58|Humanos|Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.
59|Humanos|Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife. In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
60|Humanos|Two football fans were arrested last night near the stadium. The suspects were taken to the police station for further investigation. They allegedly stole a brand new Ferrari. The owner of the car told the police that the thieves were wearing a football team jersey. After the suspects were caught, the owner of the car was called to identify the thieves. However, the owner of the car said that he had made a huge mistake because the car hadn’t been stolen. The car had been taken by his wife to go to a concert because her car was broken.
61|Humanos|Her husband, Yothin, was working as the chief electrician on the 24th floor of the unfinished tower when it collapsed. She and Yothin - who are both in their mid-30s - are from a village in northern Thailand. Yothin came to Bangkok to work on the construction site and send the money back to his family. Kannika has travelled more than 300km in the aftermath of the earthquake to wait for news about her missing husband. He's one of thousands of workers in Thailand who migrate to the capital to try to build a better future for their family.
62|Humanos|Donald Trump has said he "couldn't care less" if carmakers raise prices after his 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles comes into effect. Some analysts have warned that Trump's charges on businesses importing vehicles could lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. But speaking to NBC News on Saturday, the US president said he hoped foreign carmakers raise prices as it means "people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty".

It’s missing the spark of Star Wars that made the franchise great. The Rise of Skywalker tries to tie up loose ends from the previous two trilogies, but it does so in a way that feels forced and unsatisfying. The plot is convoluted and the pacing is awkward. Characters make strange decisions, and fan service moments often interrupt the narrative flow. Despite impressive visuals and fast-paced sequences, the emotional stakes fall flat. The film rushes through major revelations without giving them the weight they deserve.

The virus was particularly deadly in healthy adults in their 30s, a demographic that was typically at the peak of its physical and productive powers. This year marks the 100th anniversary of that pandemic. The Spanish Flu was a catalyst for the development of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as well as for many of today's public health practices. The Spanish Flu was a harbinger of the dangers that pandemics pose, and the need for the world's nations to collaborate on public health crises, as we see happening now in the battle against the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.

In fact, it is estimated that at least 50% of human seasonal H1N1 infections are caused by swine-origin H1N1 viruses, according to a study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their colleagues. This means that there are still many things we don’t know about the H1N1 virus, which is why the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public health organizations are working hard to monitor and respond to outbreaks of the flu in the United States. One way they are doing this is by using a process called genomic surveillance.

92|Humanos|In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most lucrative product, the Gros Michel banana, known as Big Mike. And now it’s happening again to Big Mike’s successor – the Cavendish. With its easily transported, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant dominated the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and exporter in South America at the time, mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible: it cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and cultivated them in densely packed fields.
93|Humanos|Unfortunately, these conditions are also perfect for the spread of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, which attacks the plant’s roots and prevents it from transporting water to the stem and leaves. The TR-1 strain of the fungus was resistant to crop sprays and travelled around on boots or the tyres of trucks, slowly infecting plantations across the region. In an attempt to escape the fungus, farmers abandoned infected fields, flooded them and then replanted crops somewhere else, often cutting down rainforest to do so.
94|Humanos|Racing against the inevitable, scientists are working on solving the problem by genetically modifying the Cavendish with genes from TR-4-resistant banana species. Researchers at the Queensland University of Technology have successfully grown two kinds of modified plant which have remained resistant for three years so far. But some experts think this is just a sophisticated version of the same temporary solution the original Cavendish provided. If the new bananas are planted in the same monocultures as the Cavendish and the Gros Michel before it, the risk is that another strain of the disease may rise up to threaten the modified plants too.
95|Humanos|When I first heard that Shonda Rhimes would make her Netflix debut with Bridgerton, a sweeping period drama about scandal and class taking place during Regency-era London’s debutante season, I was sold. My hopes were high for what sounded like some sort of 19th century Gossip Girl, until I watched it. After a few episodes, I found some elements of the series to be irksome. But there was one prevailing problem with which I took issue. The rules that the world of Bridgerton asks its viewers to accept—namely, it being a historically accurate reflection of high society from that era—are flimsy, and transferring contemporary American politics to characters from 19th century London has implications in the current moment that cannot be taken lightly.
96|Humanos|The cartoonish fantasy and romance in Bridgerton aren’t the problem—people, living isolated in their homes while a virus ravages the planet, need both of those things acutely right now. Why else do you think Emily in Paris was such a success, despite being ridiculed by critics at every turn? Escapism is a necessity at the moment, and while we’re choosing our own adventures at home, there are legions of viewers who would prefer to go full Shondaland fantasy (Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal fans know what this means) than dive into something like The Mandalorian.
97|Humanos|Again, Scandal fans may have already clocked this—but this moment calls to mind the scene in which Olivia Pope’s father reminds her why Black people have to be “twice as good” at everything to get half the respect that white folks receive. For Scandal, a contemporary show made during the Obama era about a political fixer, that sort of speech worked. Trying to retrofit those same contemporary racial politics onto Bridgerton does not.
98|Humanos|Bridgerton's latest serving of high society seduction and scandal is as beguiling as ever, some critics have declared - although others think the Netflix series' charms are wearing off. The show's third season has been described as "its best yet" and "still unbearably sexy". But other reviewers cautioned that it's "losing its bite", and that its period drama formula "is wearing decidedly thin". Four episodes were released on Thursday, with the second half of the third season due to arrive in June.
99|Humanos|Bridgerton, the first TV series made by Shondaland for Netflix, hit both Britain and the USA on December 25, 2020. A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy. The show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic “Bridgerton“ offers. 
100|ChatGpt|Bridgerton has redefined how historical fiction is perceived by modern audiences. With its vibrant costumes, diverse cast, and dramatic storytelling, the Netflix series blends Regency-era aesthetics with contemporary social themes.

This creative choice has sparked both praise and debate, highlighting the show's cultural impact. Moreover, the romantic plots and character dynamics have made the series a favorite on social media, especially among younger viewers. Fans eagerly discuss theories, relationships, and upcoming seasons, contributing to a global conversation.
101|ChatGpt|TikTok has transformed the way people consume and create content. What began as a platform for short dance videos has evolved into a space for education, activism, humor, and marketing. With its algorithm-driven feed, TikTok ensures that creators can go viral regardless of their follower count, democratizing digital fame. This has made it especially popular among Gen Z, who use the app not only for entertainment but also for self-expression and community-building. Brands, too, have recognized its power, launching campaigns that target trends and memes to boost visibility. However, concerns about data privacy and the platform’s influence on mental health continue to raise questions.

His presidency marked a shift in tone, strategy, and communication, particularly through his use of social media. Supporters praise him for challenging political norms, promoting economic growth, and focusing on American interests. Critics, however, highlight his divisive rhetoric, policy decisions, and handling of major crises. Even after leaving office, Trump’s influence remains strong within the Republican Party, and he continues to shape political discourse through rallies, endorsements, and public statements. His potential return to the political stage in future elections is a subject of intense speculation. 
103|ChatGpt|Bridgerton offers more than just romance and drama; it provides a lens into a reimagined past. Through its lavish sets and character-driven storytelling, the show creates an alternate history where race, gender, and class are explored with nuance and fantasy. What sets Bridgerton apart is its willingness to challenge genre conventions while remaining entertaining. The show’s narrator, Lady Whistledown, adds a layer of intrigue and commentary, reminiscent of modern gossip culture. Viewers are drawn not just to the relationships but also to the power struggles and emotional complexity. 
104|ChatGpt|Bridgerton has sparked renewed interest in period dramas worldwide. Its popularity demonstrates how audiences crave stories that combine classic settings with modern sensibilities. From fashion trends to renewed discussions on race in media, the series’ influence is far-reaching. The show's casting choices and bold storytelling have invited both admiration and critique, but few can deny its role in redefining the genre.
105|ChatGpt|TikTok is increasingly being used as a tool for learning and skill development. Beyond dance challenges and lip-syncing, users now share tutorials on cooking, coding, language learning, and financial literacy. Short videos, often under one minute, make complex topics more digestible. This shift has transformed TikTok into a micro-learning hub. Experts and educators are leveraging the platform to reach younger audiences in creative ways. However, the informal nature of content raises concerns about accuracy and misinformation.
106|ChatGpt|TikTok trends now influence not only pop culture but also consumer behavior. Viral product reviews, “TikTok made me buy it” hauls, and user-generated ads have turned the app into a powerful marketing engine. Small businesses in particular benefit from organic exposure. A single viral video can drive massive traffic and sales, often without paid promotion. As a result, brands closely monitor the platform, trying to stay ahead of trends and connect with audiences authentically.
107|ChatGpt|Donald Trump has reshaped the role of the modern political figure. Unlike traditional politicians, he leveraged his celebrity status to bypass conventional media, using direct communication to energize his base. His speeches, often controversial, were designed to provoke and dominate news cycles. This strategy changed how political campaigns are run, placing greater emphasis on media visibility and emotional resonance. While many disagree with his methods, his approach undeniably transformed the landscape of political messaging.
108|ChatGpt|Donald Trump’s business background remains central to his public persona. Long before his political career, he built a brand around real estate, television, and personal success. Supporters see him as a self-made entrepreneur who understands economic systems, while critics question the transparency and ethics of his business dealings. His identity as a businessman-turned-president blurs the line between corporate strategy and public governance, challenging long-held assumptions about leadership and experience in politics.
